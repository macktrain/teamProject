# Group Project: PetHarmony
PetHarmony is a pet finding application used to help the user find the perfect pet.  Approximetly 3.2 million animals are adopted each year. Our application makes the adoption process a easier, by helping the user to find the specific pet they would like, and directing the user to the pets destination. Our applications runs the Petfinder and Mapbox API. Petfinder allows us to access a database of pets ready for adoption, their location, and contact information. Mapbox I used to guide the user to their new pets location. 
Our application will promt the user on the type of pet, gender of pet and the users current area. With that information, our application should share the results of the adoptable pets with the user area. With the results, more information will be displayed, like the name of the pet, the specific address of pet and contact information for the pet. Then using Mapbox, you will be able to type in the pet's address and the user will be able to go meet with the pet.
